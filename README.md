# Multitargeting with .NET

This repository shows how to multitarget a Windows project against .NET Framework and .NET. It shows how to use newer C# features that depend
on types that don't exist in .NET Framework. It also shows how to use source generated interop with CsWin32.

See comments in the csproj files for more info.
